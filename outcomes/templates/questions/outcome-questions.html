    <p>Outcomes are expressed in the positive. This is nothing to do with 'Positive thinking' or 'positive' in the sense
      of being good for you. Positive here means ' directed towards something you want' rather than 'away from something
      you wish to avoid'. <br><br> So, ask: 'What do I want?' not 'What do i not want, or want to avoid?'<br><br> How do
      you turn a negative into a positive outcome? Byasking: 'What do I want instead?' and 'What will this do for me?'

    <p>It is important to know you are on track for your outcome. You need the right feedback in the right quantity, and
      it needs to be accurate. When you set an outcome you must think how you will measure the progress and with what
      degree of precision.<br><br>There are two kinds of evidence:<br><br>1. Feedback as you progress towards the outcome.
      How will you know you are on track?<br>2. Evidence for having achieved the outcome. How will you know that you have
      got it?<br><br>Ask:<br>How will I know that I am on course towards my outcome? What am I going to measure?<br>
      How will I know when I have achieved this outcome? What will I see, hear or feel?

    <p>Where do you want the outcome? Where specifically? There may be places and situations where you do not want it.
      you may want to increase productivity, but only in certain departments. You may want to buy a house, but not if
      interest rates rise beyond a certain point. <br><br> When do you want it? You may need to meet a deadline or you
      may not want the outcome before a specific date, beacuse other elements would not be in placce to take advantage
      of it. Ask: <br> <br> Where specifically do I want this?<br> When specifically do I want this?<br> In what context
      do I want this?

      List your resources. They will fall into five categories, some more relevant than others, depending on your outcome:
      <br><br><b>Objects -></b> Examples would be office equipment, buildings and technology. There may be books you can
      read, television and video programs you can see, tapes you can listen to. <br><br><b>People -></b> For example,
      family, friends, acquaintances, your business colleagues, other business contacts.<br>  <br><b>Role models -></b>
      Do you know anyone who has already succeeded in getting the outcome? Whom can you talk to? Has someone written about
      their experience?<br>  <br><b>Personal qualities -></b> What qualities do you have or need to develop to achieve the
      outcome? Think of all your personal skills and capabilities. <br>  <br><b>Money -></b> Do you have enough? Can you
      raise enough? <br>

    <p>
      How much is under your direct control? What can you so and what do others have to do to get this outcome? Who will
      they help you? How can you motivate them to actually want to help you rather than feeling they have to help you? Ask
      : <br><br>What can I do directly to get this outcome?<br>How can I persuade others to help me? What can I offer them\
      that will make them want to halp?

    <p>
      You can apply this at both the individual and organization level. First the individual level. Suppose you want to
      manage a project. Being involved with this project might mean a great deal of time away from home. It might mean
      dropping other projects. It might take you away from you main career path. Although you would like to be involved,
      on balance it just does not suit you. You might ask "What does working on this project accomplish for me?" If the
      answer is to gain valuable experience, then there may be other projects, or training and consulting might be
      preferable. <br><br>     The same is true at the organization level. Each company has a certain culture and a set
      of core values that define its identity. Company outcomes need to be aligned with this corporate self. Many
      companies come unstuck through diversifying into areas in which they are inexperienced and which do not fit their
      identity. <br><br>    Many a company has a strong identity that is characteristic of its founder and this can work
      to its advantage. Richard branson of Virgin started an airline, which was very different from his original music
      business, but he and Virgin are identified with innovation. so the move was profitable.

      How to you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. <br><br>
      If the outcome is too large, list all the obstacles that prevent you from getting it and set smaller outcomes to
      get over these barriers. Ask: <br><br> What prevents me from achieving this outcome?<br><br>    When you are
      knee-deep in crocodiles, it's hard to remember yoy went in to drain the swamp.<br>When the outcome is too small to
      be motivating, and you feel bogged down with details, ask yourself<br><br>What does this small outcome get for me?
      Connect the details to the larger, more motivating outcome of which it is part.

      Once you have put your plan through these questions, then you are ready to act. or perhaps delegate. When delegating
      in business project, give your people the wider picture, so they can connect their tasks with the larger project.
      Make sure they know how to think outcomes through for themselves. This will ensure that their tasks are aligned with
      yours.<br><br>    Remember the story of the two builders? Both were asked what they were doing. The first said,
      "I'm laying bricks." The second said "I'm building a wonderful building." <br><br> Guess which builder was more
      motivated and worked better?
